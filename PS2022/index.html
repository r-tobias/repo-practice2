  <h4> Summary of Moulin Rouge </h4>
  <p> The plot follows naïve, penniless English writer Christian in bohemian Paris, falling for beautiful courtesan, Satine. Glittering star of the low-life Moulin Rouge, Satine is dying of consumption. Manager, Harold Zidler, desperate to save his theatre, trades her sexual favours to a wealthy English Duke. Forced to choose between love and poverty with Christian, or musical career for sexuality to the Duke to save the cast, Satine rejects Christian to protect his life. When Christian angrily invades the spectacular stage show, she declares her love. As they sing a duet, the cast overthrow the Duke’s gun intended for Christian’s death, and virtuous love triumphs over villainy in seemingly glorious Technicolor.
